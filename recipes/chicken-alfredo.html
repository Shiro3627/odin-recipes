            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>
                <li>1 large clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>8 ounces fettucine, broken in half</li>
                <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>¾ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
              </ul>

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice each chicken breast horizontally into 3 thinner pieces using a  <br> sharp knife. Sprinkle each chicken piece with garlic salt and Italian seasoning on both sides.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until <br>  golden and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side. Remove onto a plate.</li>
                <li>Add milk and garlic to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and add fettuccine.  <br> Cook, stirring every 30 seconds to prevent sticking until pasta has softened,  <br> about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring every couple of  <br> minutes, 6 to 7 minutes more. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese. Simmer,  <br> stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened and pasta is cooked, about 2 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
              </ol>
